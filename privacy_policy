- Your name
- Your email address
- Any device or usage information
- Your location or IP address

2. How We Use Your Information

Since we do not collect any personal information, there is no data to use for any purpose. The App operates without requiring any personal details, and thus, we do not process, store, or use any data related to your identity.

4. Data Security

Because we do not collect or store personal data, no specific security measures are required for protecting user data. However, we maintain general security practices to ensure that our App is protected from unauthorized access or malicious activities.

5. Your Rights

As we do not collect or store personal data, there are no specific rights to exercise under privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). If we ever change our data collection practices, we will update this policy and notify users accordingly.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements.
